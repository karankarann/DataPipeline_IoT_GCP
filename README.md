# Building an IoT Analytics Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform

This project focused on creating a robust and scalable pipeline for analyzing IoT data streams using Google Cloud services. The workflow involved:

## Connecting and Managing Devices:

Used Cloud IoT Core to connect and manage simulated MQTT-based devices (using simulated devices)

## Data Ingestion:

Utilized Cloud Pub/Sub to ingest streams of data from Cloud IoT Core. This setup enabled real-time messaging and facilitated the seamless flow of data through the pipeline.

## Data Processing:

Implemented Cloud Dataflow to process the ingested data in real-time. This involved applying various transformations and aggregations, ensuring the data was ready for analysis.

## Data Analysis:

Used BigQuery to analyze the processed data. Leveraged its powerful SQL-based querying capabilities to generate insights and visualizations that demonstrated the value of IoT data in understanding device behavior and performance.

The project showcased how Google Cloudâ€™s fully managed services can be effectively integrated to manage and analyze data from millions of globally distributed IoT devices. By utilizing Cloud IoT Core, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery, the project provided a comprehensive solution for transforming raw IoT data into actionable insights.
